# Search Enhancements

## Overview
The search functionality has been enhanced to show pinned items and recipes at the top of search results when they match the user's query. This provides a more streamlined user experience by prioritizing frequently used items.

## Features

### Pinned Items Priority
- Pinned foods and exercises that match the search query appear at the top of results
- Pinned items have a blue background (`bg-blue-50`) with a blue left border
- Visual indicator shows "üìå Pinned" label
- Pin/unpin button is still available for regular items

### Recipe Integration
- User-created recipes that match the search query appear after pinned items
- Recipes have a green background (`bg-green-50`) with a green left border
- Visual indicator shows "üë®‚Äçüç≥ Recipe" label
- Recipes don't show pin buttons since they're already user-created

### Visual Distinction
- **Pinned Items**: Blue background with blue border and "üìå Pinned" label
- **Recipes**: Green background with green border and "üë®‚Äçüç≥ Recipe" label
- **Regular Items**: Standard hover background

## Implementation Details

### Modified Files
1. `src/hooks/useSearch.js` - Added logic to filter and prioritize pinned items and recipes
2. `src/components/Search/Search.jsx` - Updated UI to show different background colors and labels
3. `src/pages/FoodPage.jsx` - Updated to pass userProfile to useSearch hook
4. `src/pages/ExercisePage.jsx` - Updated to pass userProfile to useSearch hook
5. `src/components/nutrition/RecipeCreator.jsx` - Updated to pass userProfile to useSearch hook

### Search Result Order
1. Pinned items that match the query
2. Recipes that match the query
3. Regular library items that match the query
4. API search results (for food searches)

### Matching Logic
- Food items: Matches against `food_name`, `label`, or `name` fields
- Exercise items: Matches against `name` field
- Case-insensitive partial matching

## Benefits
- **Faster Access**: Frequently used items appear first
- **Visual Clarity**: Easy to distinguish between different item types
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Reduces need to scroll through long lists
- **Consistent Experience**: Works for both local library and API searches

## Future Considerations
- This enhancement sets the foundation for removing separate pinned items and recipe UI sections
- The search bar becomes the primary way to access all items
- Could add additional filtering options (e.g., "Show only pinned items")
